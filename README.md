# Signal App

This project is a app that checks the price variation of the listed currencies.
It them dispay the current price, price variation for the last 24h and the graph of the price variation too.

I have used to start the project the MERN Boilerplate (https://github.com/keithweaver/MERN-boilerplate).

The app was built using:
* Node
* React
* SASS
* Webpack
* Nomics API

## Tech Stack
Give it a try following this steps:
1. Clone or download the project
2. Change the env dummy file and the config dummy file
3. Insert your API Key for Nomics (You can get one here: https://docs.nomics.com/)
4. Run the build command 'npm start'
5. Have fun!
